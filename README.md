Use this repository to build the homepage. Clone it next to the [homepage][0]
repository as ``homepage-build`` and change directories into the ``homepage``
directory. Then:

    make -f ../homepage-build/build.Makefile

(Sorry for the hardcoded path in the Makefile, that will be fixed at some
point. When we figure out how to do it properly. Pull requests appreciated)
